## Introduction

When working with 3D models, especially in game development, the way you export your assets can significantly impact your workflow. Blender and Unity are two powerful tools, but exporting models between them can be tricky. This repository provides a solution to ensure that your models are exported correctly, with all positions reset and without any materials. This helps avoid unnecessary complications when importing into Unity.

## Features

- **Easy Export**: Quickly export your Blender models to FBX format.
- **Position Reset**: Automatically resets the position of your models before export.
- **No Materials**: Exports without any materials, making it easier to manage assets in Unity.
- **Python Script**: Utilizes Python scripting to automate the export process.
